The initial, regular Tacotron model was trained first on LJSpeech, and then on a heavily modified version of the Ellen McClain dataset (all non-Portal 2 voice lines removed, punctuation added).  The Forward Tacotron model was only trained on about 600 voice lines.  The HiFiGAN model was generated through transfer learning from the preexisting sample on the website.  All models have been optimized and quantized.
